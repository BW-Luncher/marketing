          <h1>Our Mission:</h1>
          <p>
            Everyday there are children across the United States that go without
            a school lunch. We intend to help deliver lunch to every single
            child that cannot afford one at schools near and far. Proper
            nutrition is essential for children to grow and learn. We believe
            that a school should be a place that can guarantee a meal to a child
            in need. Hopefully, our application will help build better schools,
            communities, and individuals; one meal at a time.

            We realize that getting lunches to kids in need is at its core a
            funding issue. That is why we created Luncher, the app that allows
            schools to broadcast the needs of their students by declaring an
            amount of donations that would need to be fulfilled in order to
            provide lunches for those that go without.
